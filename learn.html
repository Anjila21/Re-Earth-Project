    <h1>Learn about Re-cycling</h1>
    <p>The more we recycle, the less garbage winds up in our landfills and incineration
      plants. By reusing aluminum, paper, glass, plastics, and other materials, we can
      save production and energy costs, and reduce the negative impacts that the
      extraction and processing of virgin materials has on the environment.</p>

        <h2>Importance of recycling</h2>
        <p>Recycling is important in today’s world if we want to leave this planet
          for our future generations. It is good for the environment since we are
          making new products from the old products which are of no use to us.
          Recycling begins at home. If you are not throwing away any of your old
          products and instead utilizing it for something new, then you are actually
          recycling.

          </br>When you think of recycling, you should really think about the whole idea;
          reduce, reuse and recycle. We’ve been careless up to this point with the way
          we’ve treated the Earth, and it’s time to change, not just the way we do things
          but the way we think.
