                    plants. By reusing aluminum, paper, glass, plastics, and other materials, we can
                    save production and energy costs, and reduce the negative impacts that the

                    <p>Recycling is important in today’s world if we want to leave this planet
                        for our future generations. It is good for the environment since we are
                        making new products from the old products which are of no use to us.
                        Recycling begins at home. If you are not throwing away any of your old
                        products and instead utilizing it for something new, then you are actually
                        recycling.

                        </br>When you think of recycling, you should really think about the whole idea;
                        reduce, reuse and recycle. We’ve been careless up to this point with the way
                        we’ve treated the Earth, and it’s time to change, not just the way we do things
                        but the way we think.
