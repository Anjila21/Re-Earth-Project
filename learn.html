            In 2020, the world was estimated to generate 2.24 billion tonnes of
            solid waste, amounting to a footprint of 0.79 kilograms per person
            per day. With rapid population growth and urbanization, annual waste
            generation is expected to increase by 73% from 2020 levels to 3.88
            billion tonnes in 2050.
