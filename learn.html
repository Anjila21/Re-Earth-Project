    <h1>Learn about Re-cycling</h1>
    <p>The more we recycle, the less garbage winds up in our landfills and incineration 
        plants. By reusing aluminum, paper, glass, plastics, and other materials, we can 
        save production and energy costs, and reduce the negative impacts that the 
        extraction and processing of virgin materials has on the environment.</p>

            <h2>Importance of recycling</h2>
            <p>Recycling is important in today’s world if we want to leave this planet 
                for our future generations. It is good for the environment since we are 
                making new products from the old products which are of no use to us. 
                Recycling begins at home. If you are not throwing away any of your old 
                products and instead utilizing it for something new, then you are actually
                 recycling.

            </br>When you think of recycling, you should really think about the whole idea;
             reduce, reuse and recycle. We’ve been careless up to this point with the way 
             we’ve treated the Earth, and it’s time to change, not just the way we do things
              but the way we think.
