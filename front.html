            In 2020, the world was estimated to generate 2.24 billion tonnes of 
            solid waste, amounting to a footprint of 0.79 kilograms per person 
            per day. With rapid population growth and urbanization, annual waste 
            generation is expected to increase by 73% from 2020 levels to 3.88 
            billion tonnes in 2050.

          <h4>Compositing</h4>
          <p>Composting is the process of turning organic waste into nutrients for the soil through the process of decomposing. This process recycles organic materials that would otherwise be buried in landfills. Compost is rich in nutrients, and assists in healthier and quicker growth of plants. And it’s very easy to do! Follow our tips, and you’ll be creating compost in no time! Now, you’ll have 100% certified organic homemade compost instead of questionable commercial chemical-filled compost!</p>
          <p>We promote people do adpot the culture of Composting.We activly promote Home Composting, Pit Composting, Vermicomposting and Backyard Composting </p>

          <h4>Shredding</h4>
        <p>In today's rapidly modernizing economy, information security is more important than ever. Theft, vandalism, and industrial espionage are increasing security problems. Data breaches can put your organization at risk and tarnish your reputation. Most organizations resort to burning documents to ensure confidentiality. However, burning documents leads to serious negative environmental and health impacts like air pollution and lung damage while also not guaranteeing complete data destruction. Our shredding service ensures that your sensitive information is completely destroyed in an environmentally friendly manner. We provide both on-site and off-site shredding, after which we recycle your shredded documents.
         <p><b>Do not let confidential information fall into the wrong hands.
          Use our shredding services today for safe and responsible document destruction.</b></p>

              <h4>E-Waste</h4>
              <p>E-Waste is a term that describes any discarded electronic or electrical item
                that no longer serves a purpose to its owner.</p>
              <p>It is our goal for the future to instill a culture of reducing, reusing and recycling and make the streets and landfills of Nepal devoid of our discarded e-waste. Not only would this be a boon for the environment, it would also boost the local economy and allow access to a wealth of secondary raw materials our e-waste would produce.</p>
