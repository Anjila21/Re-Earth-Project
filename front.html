            In 2020, the world was estimated to generate 2.24 billion tonnes of 
            solid waste, amounting to a footprint of 0.79 kilograms per person 
            per day. With rapid population growth and urbanization, annual waste 
            generation is expected to increase by 73% from 2020 levels to 3.88 
            billion tonnes in 2050.

            <h4>E-Waste</h4>
            <p>E-Waste is a term that describes any discarded electronic or electrical item
              that no longer serves a purpose to its owner.</p>
            <p>It is our goal for the future to instill a culture of reducing, reusing and recycling and make the streets and landfills of Nepal devoid of our discarded e-waste. Not only would this be a boon for the environment, it would also boost the local economy and allow access to a wealth of secondary raw materials our e-waste would produce.</p>
